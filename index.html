			I am on a new journey in life. When I graduated highschool I already had my Cosmotology licence. I had an idea that I would use that to pay may way thought college where I would go to school and figure out what I wanted to do with my life. As with most people this didn't go as planned life got in my way. 10 years later I am on a new path that is taking me where I always wanted to go.

		<p id="p2">
			This first started with getting out of doing hair and into a job indistry that I wanted to move forward in, Technology. I started working as a tech-support agent to get my feet wet and see what oportunities are out there. Now that I know I want to work in more Dev-Op's/Product develpment side of the company. I am now going back to school at the University of Utah's coading bootcamp.
